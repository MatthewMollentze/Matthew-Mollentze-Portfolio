Currently working as a Senior Frontend Developer at Betway Africa, I focus on developing and maintaining responsive web applications using Vue.js/Nuxt. I specialize in banking applications and back-office tools, collaborating with UX designers and backend teams to create intuitive user experiences.

I am creative, resourceful and flexible, able to adapt to changing priorities and maintain a positive attitude and strong work ethic. My experience includes leading the development of innovative features like Betway Pay To Card, a first-of-its-kind solution in South Africa's betting industry.

I am highly organised and independent, able to effectively coordinate tasks to accomplish projects with timeliness and creativity.

In my spare time, I enjoy dabbling with mechatronics, home automation and reading.
