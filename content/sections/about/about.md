I am creative, resourceful and flexible, am able to adapt to changing priorities and maintain a positive attitude and strong work ethic.

I am highly organised and independent; able to effectively coordinate tasks to accomplish projects with timeliness and creativity.

In my spare time, I enjoy dabbling with mechatronics, home automation, and reading.
